 * \brief Optical flow pipeline using BriefMatch.
 *
 * OFPipeline setups an optical flow pipeline that can be executed. This
 * includes loading parameters, setting up memory structures, and then
 * executing the optical flow estimation. The execution loads images, performs
 * dense binary feature matching, filters the initial correspondence field, and
 * outputs the result to disc.
 *
